# Controlling-Servo-Motor

## The project was created using an Arduino to control 5 servo motors by typing the angle in the serial monitor.
Three circuit diagrams was provided:
1- Cont-5-SM(Circuit).png
This to show how the servos are connected with the Arduino.
2- Cont-5-SM(0 degree).jpg
This to show the circuit when the simulation begins.
3- Cont-5-SM(180 degree).jpg
This to show the simulation of the circuit after entering an angle of 180 in the serial monitor.

last but not least is the code and it was provided in the .ino file.

to sum up, any angle from 0 to 180 can be entered to set the servos to the desired degree.
